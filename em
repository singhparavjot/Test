Subject: Follow-Up on Pending Access Requests for DevOps, GitHub, Databricks, and SQL  

Dear [Recipient's Name],  

I hope this email finds you well.  

I am reaching out to follow up on our pending access requests for various platforms critical to our CI/CD pipeline and ongoing operations. Below is a summary of the current status:  

1. **Azure DevOps**:  
   - Access to the organization is required to facilitate our CI/CD pipelines.  

2. **GitHub**:  
   - We have submitted the access request, but it is currently pending approval from Pablo, who is out of office.  
   - I have attempted to reach out to other members of the approval group but have not received a response so far.  

3. **Databricks and SQL**:  
   - Our access requests are pending with Laura, who will be unavailable until 7th January.  

Given the timelines and dependencies involved, I would appreciate your guidance on how we can expedite these approvals or if there are alternative points of contact to address these requests in the interim.  

Thank you for your support and understanding. Please let me know if any additional information is required from my end.  

Best regards,
