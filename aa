CI/CD for SQL using Azure Pipelines automates the deployment of database changes, ensuring consistency and minimizing manual effort. The process typically involves versioning SQL scripts or DACPAC files in a Git repository. The pipeline starts with a build stage, where changes are validated, and artifacts (e.g., DACPAC or migration scripts) are generated. In the release stage, these artifacts are deployed to target environments (e.g., dev, test, production) using tools like SQLPackage, Azure SQL Deployment tasks, or PowerShell scripts. This approach ensures reliable, automated, and repeatable deployments while maintaining version control and enabling rollback if needed.
