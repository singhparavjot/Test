Over the next two to three years, I aim to transition into an Azure Solution Architect role, leveraging my current expertise in Azure DevOps and cloud infrastructure. My goal is to design and implement scalable, secure, and cost-effective cloud solutions that align with business objectives. I plan to enhance my architectural skills by gaining hands-on experience with enterprise-level solutions, exploring advanced Azure services, and achieving relevant certifications like Azure Solutions Architect Expert. Additionally, I aim to strengthen my leadership abilities, develop a deeper understanding of multi-cloud strategies, and expand my knowledge of AI-driven innovations to design future-ready architectures. This progression will enable me to contribute more strategically to organizational success while advancing toward my long-term aspiration of becoming a Cloud Solutions Architect.
