Best Practices
Define Clear Roles:
Specify who can approve and merge PRs.
Use repository settings to enforce role-based access.
Combine with CI/CD:
Integrate automated tests to verify changes before they are reviewed.
Allow deployment pipelines to run only after PR approvals.
Use Templates:
Standardize PR descriptions to ensure reviewers have all the necessary context.
Automate Approvals for Lower Environments:
For non-production branches, use automated checks to streamline the workflow.
