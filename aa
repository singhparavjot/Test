CI/CD for Tableau using Azure Pipelines automates the deployment of Tableau workbooks and data sources across environments, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors. The process involves exporting workbooks from a source environment (e.g., dev-site) using tabcmd, then publishing them to the target environment (e.g., sit-site) along with their associated data sources. Extracts can be refreshed to ensure up-to-date data. Key steps include logging into Tableau Server, exporting the workbook, publishing it with the correct project and site configurations, refreshing data extracts, and validating the deployment. This approach integrates Tableau content management into modern DevOps workflows, providing a streamlined and repeatable deployment pipeline.
