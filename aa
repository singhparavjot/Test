When writing about **access and privilege management on Git** for a design document, you should address how access is controlled, roles are assigned, and the best practices for securing repositories. Here's a concise section you can include in your design document:

### **Access and Privilege Management on Git**

**Overview**:
Access and privilege management in Git ensures secure collaboration by defining roles and permissions for users and teams within the repository. It prevents unauthorized changes and protects sensitive code and data.

**Key Elements**:
1. **Roles and Permissions**:
   - **Owner/Admin**: Full control, including managing permissions, branches, and repository settings.
   - **Maintainer**: Manages branches and reviews/merges pull requests.
   - **Contributor**: Creates feature branches, commits changes, and submits pull requests.
   - **Reader**: View-only access to the repository.

2. **Access Levels**:
   - **Repository Level**: Controls access to specific repositories (e.g., read, write, admin).
   - **Branch Level**: Defines permissions per branch (e.g., restrict direct commits to `main`).

3. **Authentication**:
   - Use **SSH keys**, **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**, or **OAuth** for secure authentication.
   - Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users.

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Implement **branch protection rules** to enforce pull requests and code reviews for merging changes to `main` or `develop`.
   - Use **Git hooks** for pre-commit validation.
   - Regularly audit user permissions and remove unused access.
   - Use Git services' team/group features to simplify privilege management (e.g., Azure Repos, GitHub Teams).

5. **Sensitive Data Management**:
   - Prohibit storing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, keys) in repositories.
   - Use tools like Git hooks or automated scanners to detect secrets in commits.

**Implementation in Azure Repos**:
- Use Azure DevOps permissions to define role-based access control (RBAC) for repositories and pipelines.
- Restrict sensitive branches (`main`, `release`) to maintainers and admins only.
- Enable policies like **required reviewers**, **build validation**, and **work item linking** to enforce quality and traceability.
