Here's a structured approach to creating a **small presentation** on building an artifact in one Azure DevOps project and deploying it in another.

- **Subtitle**: *"Building and Deploying Artifacts Across Projects"*
- **Your Name**
- **Date**

#### **Slide 3: Introduction**
- **What is CI/CD?**
  - Continuous Integration (CI): Build and package code.
  - Continuous Deployment (CD): Deploy artifacts to target environments.
- **Why Cross-Project Pipelines?**
  - Modularize pipelines for scalability.
  - Reuse components across projects.

---

#### **Slide 4: Workflow Overview**
- **Diagram**:
  - Project 1 (Build):
    - Source Code → Build → Publish Artifact.
  - Project 2 (Deploy):
    - Consume Artifact → Deploy to Target Environment.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Publish Artifact in Project 1.
  2. Reference and Download Artifact in Project 2.
  3. Deploy to Azure (or other targets).

---

#### **Slide 5: Key Azure DevOps Concepts**
1. **Artifacts**:
   - Packages or build outputs shared across pipelines.
2. **Pipeline Resources**:
   - Mechanism to link pipelines across projects.
3. **DownloadPipelineArtifact Task**:
   - Fetch published artifacts for further use.
4. **Permissions**:
   - Configure pipeline access and artifact sharing.

---

#### **Slide 6: Steps to Build and Deploy Across Projects**
1. **In Project 1**:
   - Create a pipeline to:
     - Build the application.
     - Publish an artifact (e.g., `zip` or `tar.gz`).
     ```yaml
     - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
       inputs:
         artifactName: 'my-artifact'
         targetPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
     ```
2. **In Project 2**:
   - Reference the Project 1 pipeline:
     ```yaml
     resources:
       pipelines:
         - pipeline: project1pipeline
           project: 'Project1'
           source: 'PipelineName'
           branch: 'refs/heads/main'
           run: latest
     ```
   - Download the artifact:
     ```yaml
     - task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
       inputs:
         source: project1pipeline
         artifact: 'my-artifact'
         path: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/artifact'
     ```
   - Deploy using the downloaded artifact.

---

#### **Slide 7: Demo Summary**
1. **Artifact Build in Project 1**:
   - Pipeline executed and artifact published successfully.
2. **Artifact Deployment in Project 2**:
   - Pipeline consumed the artifact and deployed it to the target environment.
3. **End-to-End Workflow Success**:
   - Artifacts shared seamlessly across projects.

---

#### **Slide 8: Challenges and Best Practices**
- **Challenges**:
  - Permissions between projects.
  - Artifact retention policies.
  - Managing dependencies between pipelines.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use consistent naming conventions for artifacts.
  - Configure proper access controls.
  - Leverage pipeline templates for reusability.

---

#### **Slide 9: Conclusion**
- Cross-project CI/CD increases modularity and reusability.
- Azure DevOps provides robust tools for artifact sharing and pipeline management.
- Implementing these workflows enables scalable, multi-project DevOps practices.

---

#### **Slide 10: Questions**
- Open the floor for questions or feedback.

---

### **Visuals and Assets**
- **Use Diagrams**:
  - Workflow diagram showing the flow from Project 1 to Project 2.
- **Screenshots**:
  - Artifact publishing in Project 1.
  - Artifact consumption and deployment in Project 2.
- **Key YAML Code Blocks**:
  - Highlight relevant YAML snippets.
